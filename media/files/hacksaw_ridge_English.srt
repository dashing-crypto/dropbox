1
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,707
<i>Have you not heard?</i>

2
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,796
<i>The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the Earth.</i>

3
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,675
<i>He will not grow tired or weary,</i>

4
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,637
<i>and His understanding no one can fathom.</i>

5
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:24,604
<i>He gives strength to the weary
and increases the power of the weak.</i>

6
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:30,360
<i>Even youths grow tired and weary,
and young men stumble and fall.</i>

7
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:34,697
<i>But those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.</i>

8
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,744
<i>They will soar on wings like eagles.</i>

9
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,622
<i>They will run and not grow weary.</i>

10
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,500
<i>They will walk and not be faint.</i>

11
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:50,255
Desmond, hang on!

12
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,758
Hang on, Desmond!

13
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:56,886
We're going to get you out of here!

14
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,737
Desmond. Desmond!

15
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:16,364
What?

16
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,450
- Wait up.
- Catch up.

17
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,870
Wait up, I've got something to tell you.

18
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,749
What, Hal?

19
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,294
Race you to the top.

20
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,962
Hey! Cheater!

21
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:44,017
- See you later, slowpoke.
- Hey!

22
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:52,275
- Want a hand?
- I got it.

23
00:03:58,448 --> 00:03:59,782
- Sit down!
- Ah, you dope!

24
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,284
- Quit it.
- You quit it.

25
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:08,249
For Pete's sake.

26
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,586
Hey! Get away from that
ledge, you damn fool kids!

27
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,296
You're going to break your necks!

28
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:18,342
It's them Doss kids.
Crazy as their old man.

29
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,730
They dug up the corner
of Jackson and Main...

30
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,400
Putting in a sidewalk...

31
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,489
You boys wouldn't recognize it now.

32
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,957
Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.

33
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,837
They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

34
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,342
It's like I died with you.

35
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,684
It's like we boys never existed.

36
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,028
Well, that's all I got for you today.

37
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:42,260
Block him with your right, Desmond.

38
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,513
Stop it! Do you hear me?

39
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,307
- What are they fighting about?
- When'd they ever need a reason?

40
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,393
Tom! Ugh!

41
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,562
Why stop 'em?
Saves me whipping them both.

42
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,480
This way, I just whip the one that wins.

43
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,026
Torn!

44
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,236
No!

45
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,737
Oh, God.

46
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,408
Tom! Wake up, can you hear me?

47
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:06,617
What the hell have you done?

48
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,869
He can't hear me.

49
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,915
I'll get some ice.

50
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,462
- You shift that basket.
- I got it.

51
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,965
Is he breathing?

52
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,093
Hal? Hal, can you hear me?

53
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,476
Hal, can you hear me?

54
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,984
Hal... Come on.

55
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,736
He's dilated.

56
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,529
Hal...

57
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,804
What do you think you're doin'?

58
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:13,976
I'm gonna have to beat you now,
you know the rules.

59
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,523
You hear me, Desmond?

60
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,109
- Desmond!
- Tom, stop.

61
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,028
What's that gonna teach the boy?

62
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,572
He's violent enough already.

63
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,075
Okay, fine,
you go smother him in kisses.

64
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:32,703
You tell him the world's
a soft and gentle place.

65
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,668
Hal's gonna be okay.

66
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,514
Hey.

67
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:59,772
- I could have killed him.
- Yes, you could have.

68
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,650
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

69
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,193
And to take another man's life,

70
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:07,989
that is the most egregious sin
in the Lord's sight.

71
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:11,909
Nothing hurts his heart so much.

72
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,369
Don't you understand English?

73
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,789
Do I have to tell you again?

74
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,916
You move, woman,
or I will wallop you good and hard!

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,835
What the hell's going on?
You okay, Bertha?

76
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,295
You mind
your own damned business!

77
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,505
Go sleep it off, Tom.

78
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,882
I hate him.

79
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,482
Momma?

80
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:46,944
Oh.

81
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,289
Why does he hate us so much?

82
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,168
Oh, he don't hate us.

83
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,673
He hates himself sometimes.

84
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,969
Your daddy tonight,
that ain't the real him.

85
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,183
I wish you knew him
like I did, before the war.

86
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,684

93

How'd we sound, Desmond?

94
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,960
Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.

95
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:47,713
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,
especially in this place.

96
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:50,383
Well, I ain't never said
they were singing angels.

97
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,015
What's going on out there? Desmond!

98
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,101
Get it up, get it up!

99
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,522
Drag him out. Just the tarp.

100
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,195
I'll phone an ambulance.

101
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,406
No, no time. Joshua's pickup.

102
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,824
- Quick!
- Okay.

103
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,719
You're going to be fine now.
You're going to be fine.

104
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,303
You're in good hands.

105
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,473
What have we got here?

106
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,058
It's a severed artery.
Get some sutures.

107
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,184
Yes, doctor.

108
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,103
Put some pressure on it.
Did you apply this tourniquet?

109
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,312
- Yes, sir.
- Nice work.

110
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,897
You might have saved this boy's life.

111
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,985
You staying with us?
You're going to be okay.

112
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,695
What's your name, son?

113
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,780
Gilbert.

114
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,782
- Surgery?
- Yeah, surgery.

115
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,826
Stay with us, you're gonna be okay.

116
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,202
You feel pain?

117
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,125
Stay with us, okay?

118
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,561
Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.

119
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,277
Are you all right?

120
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:22,826
Oh, no, that's not mine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking though, ma'am.

121
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,457
What do you need?

122
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,129
My belt.

123
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,676
I lent it to the boy
who had the accident.

124
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,803
My pants don't hold up
so good without it.

125
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,932
Well, uh, I don't have your belt.

126
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,559
No, I know that, ma'am.
It's out there.

127
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,060
It's right out there
with the boy still.

128
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:52,857
Okay. I'm just here to take blood.

129
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,693
I'll give mine.

130
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,821
Okay, go to that room over there
and wait with the others.

131
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,322
I'll call you.

132
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,871
That room.

133
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,881
You ever given blood before, Mr...

134
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,175
Doss.

135
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,971
But my friends call me Desmond.
No, ma'am, this is my first time.

136
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:38,444
I always dreamed about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get much school.

137
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,324
You may be a little dizzy
when we're done.

138
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,910
Is somebody picking you up?

139
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,203
No, ma'am. Walking back.

140
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,080
Where do you live?

141
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,498
Fort Hill, ma'am.

142
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,167
That's a ways.

143
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,546
No. Just five or six miles,
but I cut through the woods.

144
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,632
It's seven that way!

145
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,009
You must really like the woods.

146
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,094
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.

147
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,138
Okay, put some pressure here.

148
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,934
- You okay?
- Yeah.

149
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,104
Bye.

150
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,816
Where you going
looking all spruced and nice?

151
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,778
Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.

152
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,363
Her name's Dorothy Schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.

153
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,365
Goodness. Does she know that?

154
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,367
Well, not yet. She's about to.

155
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,579
You ever even spoken to a woman?
I mean, one that's not family.

156
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,082
Spoke to her.

157
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,376
Well, in that case,
come give your brother a big hug.

158
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,794
- Hal!
- Come here.

159
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,587
Keep your greasy paws off of me.

160
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,256
Wish me luck, Momma.

161
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,217
Good luck.

162
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,630
Next.

163
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,883
Grab a seat.
You ever given blood before?

164
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,010
Yes, ma'am. I have.

165
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,931
You're the belt man.

166
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,516
Desmond, yes, ma'am.

167
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,394
Well, Desmond, we can't
take your blood two days in a row.

168
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,438
Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.

169
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,898
- You what?
- My blood. I need it back.

170
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,028
Well, it don't work like that,
we can't just give it back to you.

171
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,196
Well, you got to.

172
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,698
Ever since you stuck me
with that needle,

173
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,950
my heart's been beating real fast.

174
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:52,327
Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.

175
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,458
I never heard that one before.
It's pretty corny.

176
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,543
It is?

177
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,921
That's a shame,
I done practiced that all night.

178
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,048
No good?

179
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,177
I didn't say that.

180
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,866
What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?

181
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,371
- What are you talking about?
- The boy's accident.

182
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,167
Arteries spurt blood.

183
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,629
And veins?

184
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,048
Bleed.

185
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,511
I think you need to practice

186
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,430
your boy/girl dating talk
at home before you come out.

187
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,349
Yeah, I probably do.

188
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,144
I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.

189
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,022
On dating?

190
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,067
On blood.

191
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,245
Another medical question perhaps?

192
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,623
No. I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.

193
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,293
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

194
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,342
No, you're just beautiful.

195
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,910
Out of the way!

196
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,789
You need to watch where you're going.

197
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,386
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.

198
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:16,638
You didn't ask.

199
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,643
- I thought you might have liked it.
- Well, I might have if you'd asked.

200
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,447
You coming?

201
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,868
Watch where you're walking!

202
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,099
Why didn't you say nothing to us?

203
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,060
'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,

204
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,396
- and I know what I'm doing is right.
- And what about His Commandment?

205
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,441
It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.

206
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,318
Loads of boys
from our church are going.

207
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,446
- Yeah.
- There is a war and they need men.

208
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,865
And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save this country.

209
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:30,045
Looks like a movie star, our boy.

210
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:36,677
Nice uniform, good hat.

211
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,267
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked
in his uniform when we went to France.

212
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,020
- Remember him, Bertha?
- Don't, Tom.

213
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,146
What?

214
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:54,361
I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.

215
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,114
All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.

216
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,158
He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.

217
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,958
I just hope that
when our Hal gets shot,

218
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,544
it's through the front of his jacket.

219
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,755
Like a simple entry wound,
not much mess.

220
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,632
Artie got hit in the back,

221
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:20,262
it blew most of his guts and intestines
out his front, offal everywhere.

222
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,766
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

223
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,147
It was lucky he was dead,

224
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,608
so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.

225
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,865
Get outta of my sight.

226
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,967
What are you, part mountain goat?

227
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,514
Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,

228
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,432
or are you just going
to leave me stranded?

229
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,523
I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.

230
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:55,690
What?

231
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,234
A kiss.

232
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,656
- That is pure blackmail.
- Well, yes, ma'am, it is.

233
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,699
But that is still my condition.

234
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:11,373
That's the deal.
And I'm going to hold you to it.

235
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,304
Well, hold on now.

236
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,559
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

237
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,019
'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you with me.

238
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,355
Kiss me and find out.

239
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,405
What?

240
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,617
I have to enlist.

241
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:32,412
I can't stay here while
all of them go fight for me.

242
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,332
- Yes, you can. You can stay here.
- Dorothy, I have to.

243
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,083
I want to be a medic.

244
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,377
I figure I'll be saving people,
not killing them.

245
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,675
I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.

246
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:52,307
Dorothy. Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!

247
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,771
So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?

248
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,150
Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?

249
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,403
Well, I wouldn't know,
you haven't asked.

250
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:10,117
Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart and then some.

251
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,246
- Will you marry me?
- Then, yes. Yes, I will.

252
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,382
When?

253
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,925
Soon as you get your first leave.

254
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,177
But I still don't like you
at this moment.

255
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,263
- Yeah.
- Okay.

256
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,807
Okay. Well, I love you.

257
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,017
Shh!

258
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,573
Momma said come see you here.

259
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:50,740
Yeah.

260
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,080
These three were my best friends.

261
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,917
I grew up with 'em,

262
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,711
I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.

263
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,255
And I enlisted with 'em.

264
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,801
Now my friends are there,

265
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,556
covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.

266
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,394
I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.

267
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,481
Daddy, I signed up already.

268
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,905
I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.
Everybody else is doing...

269
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,699
You ain't everybody else!

270
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,912
Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick, without thinking!

271
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:41,750
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

272
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,544
And soldiers who live,
they live because they can do that!

273
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,254
You can't!

274
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,592
Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray about everything.

275
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,636
I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.

276
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,805
You won't be able
to live with yourself if you go.

277
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,891
No, I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.

278
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:01,936
I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be my way to serve.

279
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,898
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

280
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:10,361
What, you figure this war is just
going to fit in with you, your ideas?

281
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,739
Well, I don't doubt
it's going to be hard.

282
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,494
It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.

283
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:21,373
You know, whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,

284
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,584
they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.

285
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,670
And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,

286
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,507
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

287
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,346
- Ready?
- Ready.

288
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,472
Y'all need some air.

289
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,515
Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.

290
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,019
Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.

291
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,480
Ladies, please, step away from the bus.

292
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:48,357
- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?

293
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,112
I want you to have this.
It's mine.

294
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,575
You keep it right here, where I'll be.

295
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,998
- Bye.
- Bye.

296
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,629
I love you.

297
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,127
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

298
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,753
- What else...
- Hey. Oh.

299
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,173
Hey. Sorry, pal.

300
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,216
...means you're the person.

301
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:59,596
- They got me a bum steer.
- Nah, it's just a bum.

302
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,640
Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?

303
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,351
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

304
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:11,566
You okay there?
You look lost. Vacancy right here.

305
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:15,069
Wise choice. It's got views of
the mountains down to the lake.

306
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,362
Randall Fuller.

307
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,407
Desmond Doss.

308
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,452
Call him "Teach." No one
understands a word he says.

309
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,329
That's because
no one else here can read.

310
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:27,624
The testicles there belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."

311
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,168
They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.

312
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,836
You know testicles.

313
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:36,925
Oh! Hey, I just got these shoes.

314
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:40,220
Hey, uh, Grease Nolan, outta Red Hook.
Where you from?

315
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,971
- Virginia.
- Ooh, hillbilly, huh?

316
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,809
You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.

317
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:47,852
Whoa!

318
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,063
That's Smitty over there,
whipping Kirzinski's ass.

319
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,564
Like you were doing
any better, chowder head.

320
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,150
Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.

321
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,193
Wal Kirzinski, nice to meet you.

322
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,237
Hey, beanpole,
what did you say your name was?

323
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,572
Desmond Doss.

324
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,911
That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's some kind of cowboy.

325
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:08,706
And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.

326
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,083
- Hey.
- How you doing?

327
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,751
- Desmond.
- Yeah.

328
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,586
This handsome guy
right here is Lucky Ford.

329
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,671
Hey.

330
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,674
That's Walker and Pinnick over there
pretending they're card sharks.

331
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,175
Pipe down, Grease, all right?

332
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,386
Unless you want to
put your money where your mouth is.

333
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:27,183
Oh, hey, the old good book, right?

334
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,936
I think Lucky's got a good book.

335
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,146
- Right, Lucky?
- It's a good read.

336
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,775
Attention!

337
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,653
Line up! Move it!

338
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,072
Let's go, move it. Move it.

339
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,895
You are a very
strange-looking individual

340
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,772
if you don't mind me
saying so, Private.

341
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,025
- Name?
- Andy Walker.

342
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,818
How long have you been dead, son?

343
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,279
- Sir?
- I am not "Sir"!

344
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:26,242
I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.
"Sir" you save for useless people.

345
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:31,414
- The name is "Ghoul," you say?
- Walker, Sergeant!

346
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,750
- Ghoul it is.
- Yes, Sergeant!

347
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:52,060
There's something off
in your presentation, Private.

348
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,978
Can't place it.

349
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,147
Is it your hair?

350
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,817
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

351
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,110
I have a knife in my foot, Sergeant.

352
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:06,032
Oh, yes, of course, that's it.
The knife.

353
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,950
- What is your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.

354
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:11,746
No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?

355
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,707
- Because I have a knife in my foot.
- Who placed the knife there, Private?

356
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,459
It was an accident, Sarge.
We was playing Stretch.

357
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,754
I am heartened by the knowledge you
did not place it there with intention.

358
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,674
Who threw the knife?

359
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:26,010
I did, Sergeant. Private Kirzinski.

360
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,806
You look part Indian.
To what tribe do you belong, son?

361
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,182
No, I'm Polish.

362
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,477
Wrong. I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.

363
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,270
- No, Sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me,

364
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,023
- you wagon-burning son of a bitch?
- No, Sergeant!

365
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,025
Let me see your Indian war cry, son.

366
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,235
I don't...

367
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,030
Louder! Let me see it.

368
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,909
What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?

369
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,452
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a chipmunk?

370
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,996
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a dancing reindeer?

371
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,332
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you contradicting me, Private?

372
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,043
- No, Sergeant!
- Good.

373
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,295
Then I shall henceforth call you "Chief"

374
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,590
as a sign of great respect
to your people.

375
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,134
Thank you, Sergeant!

376
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,347
Are you grinning at me, boy,
or is that your natural state?

377
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,431
No, Sergeant.

378
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,725
- Name, Private?
- Desmond Doss.

379
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:16,394
I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.

380
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,896
Makes me want to pull
an ear off, Private.

381
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,982
- Can you carry your weight?
- Yes, Sergeant!

382
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,234
Should be easy for you, then.

383
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:24,527
- Corporal.
- Sergeant.

384
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,821
Make sure you keep this man
away from strong winds.

385
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:27,988
Yes, Sergeant.

386
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,243
- Private Idiot.
- Yes, Sergeant.

387
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,620
Raise your foot. Higher.

388
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,168
Everyone outside. Now! Move it.

389
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,212
I said move it.

390
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,714
All right.
Just getting in my uniform, Sarge.

391
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,383
- Did I ask him to, Corporal?
- No memory of it, Sarge.

392
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:50,928
I believe any man who takes
such pride in his natural naked state

393
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,306
will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.

394
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:56,434
Now move your privates, Private Parts!

395
00:32:56,517 --> 00:33:00,521
Move it! You son of an exhibitionist!

396
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:04,859
I am going to teach you
how to tie a bowline knot,

397
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:08,070
so you can get your sorry asses
down from a height,

398
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,281
so I may then kick them!

399
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,451
Create a loop.
This is the rabbit hole.

400
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:17,163
The rabbit comes out of his hole,
runs around the tree,

401
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:21,876
goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!

402
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,630
Very good, Tex.

403
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,466
Keep struggling, Teach.

404
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,092
Have you ever roped a goat, Hollywood?

405
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,094
No, Sarge.

406
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:33,846
Have you ever looked into a goat's eyes?

407
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,431
- No, Sarge.
- Good, that would be unnatural.

408
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,685
You know if you don't breathe,
you'll die.

409
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:43,105
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, Private Idiot.

410
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:49,320
Congratulations, Greaseball, you just
fell 50 feet and broke your neck!

411
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,157
Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.

412
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,827
You strangled yourself, numb nuts!

413
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,662
- Are you a fan of Benito?
- No, Sergeant.

414
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:00,915
A bit taller.
If you were American, you'd be taller.

415
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:09,340
What've we got here, Doss,
one for each titty?

416
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:13,094
You were tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!

417
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:18,140
- What is so funny, Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.

418
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,813
Come on! Come on, ladies,
pick it up! Move it! Move it!

419
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,524
I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.

420
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:27,984
Show me something!

421
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,277
Run like you mean it!

422
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,113
- Down, down, down! Faster, faster!
- Come on. Move it! Move it!

423
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,740
Let's go, it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!

424
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,910
Move! Move! Move!

425
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,079
I want to see you work. Let's go!

426
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,789
Dig, dig, dig!

427
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:44,375
Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!

428
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:48,129
I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.

429
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,382
Let's go! Hustle.
Hustle. Hustle. Move!

430
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:57,597
Let's go! What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!

431
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,641
Get the wood! Get the wall!
Don't get splinters!

432
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,101
Drive!

433
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,560
Drive!

434
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,937
Jeez, are you okay?

435
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,939
Yeah, I'm fine.

436
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:10,651
- Some spirit here, boys. Move!
- Come on, move!

437
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:13,654
What the hell is wrong
with you? No one said take a rest!

438
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:17,033
Move your asses to the finish line!
Move! Move!

439
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,911
Hustle! Hustle!

440
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,204
Get your asses across that line!

441
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,042
Time! Nice work, Doss!

442
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:35,676
This is a personal gift
from the United States government

443
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,428
to each and every one of you.

444
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:42,099
A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber .30, M1,

445
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,394
a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon

446
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:49,190
designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.

447
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:54,070
This is to be your lover,
your mistress, your concubine.

448
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:58,115
Perhaps the only thing in life
you will ever truly love.

449
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,077
Fellas, let's dance. Grab a girl.

450
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,538
Don't point your gun forward.

451
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,707
I do not want to be shot today.

452
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:09,085
No matter how much you are tempted.

453
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,087
Place the weapon by your side.

454
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,507
Pay attention.

455
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,766
Problem, Private Corn Stalk?

456
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,687
Is there not one in your size,
or is it the color that is the issue?

457
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,230
No, Sarge.

458
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:35,236
I was... I was told
I don't have to carry a weapon.

459
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:38,239
Come again? Step forward, Private.
I can't be hearing this right.

460
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,663
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.

461
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,375
I can't touch a gun.

462
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,671
What exactly is the problem?

463
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,881
No problem, just a mistake, sir.

464
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,009
I told the Army when I joined up.

465
00:36:58,092 --> 00:36:59,677
That's not possible.

466
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,971
Do you know why
it's not possible, Private?

467
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,431
No, sir.

468
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:06,142
Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.

469
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:10,438
So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.

470
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,607
I was just never supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.

471
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,401
He's a C.O., sir.

472
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:24,160
You're a conscientious objector,
and you joined the Army?

473
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:28,539
Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious cooperator.

474
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:34,503
- Are you screwing with me, Doss?
- No. No, sir. I volunteered.

475
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:37,381
I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,

476
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,508
or saluting the flag and doing my duty.

477
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:43,679
It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.

478
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:48,517
- You don't kill? That's all.
- Yes, sir, that's all.

479
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,228
You know quite a bit
of killing does occur in a war?

480
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,354
Yes, sir.

481
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,398
I mean,
that is the essential nature of war.

482
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:57,735
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

483
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:01,113
Do you have any other requirements
of the United States Army?

484
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:02,948
Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure

485
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,658
that you have
a comfortable stay here with us?

486
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:07,620
He doesn't want to work
on Saturdays, sir.

487
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,956
Well, Saturdays...
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.

488
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,045
So, Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I'm not allowed to work then.

489
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,547
I don't think that poses a problem,
do you, Sergeant?

490
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,259
We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the Sabbath,

491
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,094
'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.

492
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,889
All right. Now we got that clear.

493
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,268
Now let me tell you my requirements.

494
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:34,564
They're not as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.

495
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:37,608
As long as you're in this company,
under my command,

496
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,735
you will obey my orders. Period.

497
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:45,408
If you can't do it here,
I can't trust you to do it in battle.

498
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:54,750
I'm putting you in for
a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

499
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,001
Dismissed.

500
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,796
Gentlemen!

501
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,632
I want you to meet
Private Desmond Doss.

502
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:05,886
Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.

503
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,847
He does not practice violence.

504
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,141
He will not even deign
to touch a weapon.

505
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:15,813
You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.

506
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:21,819
So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,

507
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:27,324
because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

508
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,786
- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.

509
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:37,501
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.

510
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,837
It is what we men fight for.

511
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,800
To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.

512
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:50,890
Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.

513
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:53,475
So I will expect everyone
in this company

514
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:57,855
to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due

515
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,900
for the short time he will be with us.

516
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,526
Am I clear?

517
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,070
Yes, Sergeant.

518
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:14,830
What'cha got there, Dessie?

519
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,002
You know what that is.

520
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,212
It just seems kind of small.

521
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:23,922
It's half the Bible for half the man.

522
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,591
For Pete's sake, Smitty,
give him back his Bible.

523
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,301
I don't remember speaking to you.

524
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,850
So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better than us?

525
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,602
No.

526
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:38,896
What if you was attacked?

527
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,066
Whoa!

528
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,110
Say, like that.

529
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,947
The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?

530
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,701
See, I don't think this is a question
of religion, fellas.

531
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:56,580
I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.

532
00:40:56,664 --> 00:41:00,668
Is that right, Doss?
Are you chickenshit, that it?

533
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:05,798
Go on, take a poke.

534
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,926
Tell you what, I'm going to
give you a free shot.

535
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:10,886
Right there.

536
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,099
Hit me, Doss. Go on.

537
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,558
- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.

538
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:17,685
No?

539
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,231
Chickenshit.

540
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,650
Oh.

541
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,820
Hold on here. What is this?

542
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,238
Give me that.

543
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,156
- This is a fine-looking broad.
- Nice.

544
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,783
Hey, pass it around.

545
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,912
Now, this would be the kind of
broad that deserves a real man.

546
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,331
Give me that back.

547
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,542
Please.

548
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:45,170
Please.

549
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:47,631
"Please give it back, Smitty."

550
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,675
Please give it back, Smitty.

551
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,438
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

552
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,109
No, sir.

553
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,821
But I understand that God
talks to you. Is that right?

554
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,656
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

555
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,453
Is that how you feel most people
regard you, a crazy person?

556
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:20,330
I'm different. I know that, but...

557
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,418
I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.

558
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,421
- I am what I am.
- Sounds lonely.

559
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,548
You lonely?

560
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:37,097
- So, you don't hear voices.
- No, sir.

561
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:43,437
I pray to God and I like to think He
hears me, but it ain't a conversation,

562
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,356
like the one we're pretending
to have right now.

563
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,275
- Pretending, Private?
- Well, yes, sir.

564
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,528
I know all you really want to do is give
me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,

565
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:57,075
but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe what I believe.

566
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:01,121
Well, I'm trying to
understand, all right?

567
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:05,167
Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?

568
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,378
God says not to kill.

569
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,255
That's one of His
most important Commandments.

570
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:13,884
Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."

571
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,304
War is a completely different
set of circumstances.

572
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:21,892
Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,

573
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,978
that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."

574
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:27,189
This is Satan himself we're fighting.

575
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:30,567
Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.

576
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:34,029
I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.

577
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,243
But I'm sorry,
I will not bear arms.

578
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,995
His religious views
are certainly unique,

579
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,582
but they do not constitute grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.

580
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,710
How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with a man like that in my unit?

581
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:50,295
I don't know.

582
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,631
But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,

583
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:55,091
and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,

584
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:58,720
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training.

585
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:03,475
Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.

586
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:06,228
Yeah, you restrict him
to barracks and KP.

587
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,689
If he throws God at you,
you throw hell right at him.

588
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,023
I want him gone.

589
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:30,586
Doss, your area is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!

590
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,505
- Something funny, Ryker?
- No, Sarge!

591
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:37,175
- You got some shit on your mind?
- No, Sarge!

592
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:39,803
What you men fail to recognize

593
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:44,641
is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!

594
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:49,021
Now, to help you learn that lesson,
there will be no passes this weekend.

595
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,565
You will all be on KP!

596
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:55,027
Right now, everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.

597
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,779
Let's go! Let's go.

598
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,660
Get your heads right.

599
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:05,954
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

600
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:09,124
Makes me sick
see you feel sorry for yourself.

601
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,501
You dogs don't know what tired is.

602
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:13,795
We're going to keep going till I drop.

603
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:25,682
Hey, knock it off.
Trying to sleep here.

604
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,064
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Okay. All right.

605
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:40,697
Why the hell are you still here?

606
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,502
As you were.

607
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,135
Where's Doss?

608
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,202
This isn't good for anybody.

609
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,287
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

610
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:34,751
It's not about what you joined up for.

611
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:37,379
It's about the lives
of every man in here.

612
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,926
And yours, son.
It's time to quit this.

613
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:47,055
Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.

614
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,022
It's okay, Doss.

615
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,150
There's no shame in this.

616
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:15,542
Let's go.

617
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:20,881
I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on KP this morning, so...

618
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:24,885
Can't.

619
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:32,976
All right, Doss.

620
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:39,107
Private Doss, can you identify
the men that beat you?

621
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:47,866
No, Sarge.

622
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:51,119
Are you saying that you
don't know who attacked you?

623
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:53,122
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

624
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:57,709
Well, what the hell
are you saying, Doss?

625
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:59,961
You bruised half your body sleeping?

626
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,965
I... I sleep pretty hard.

627
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:08,512
Alright.

628
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:12,140
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.

629
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:13,642
Next.

630
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,852
Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.

631
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:18,188
What, you don't want none
for your coffee, Sarge?

632
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,857
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

633
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,859
- You speaking from experience, Sarge?
- Next.

634
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,987
You'd have to ask
your mom about that, Greaseball.

635
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:31,868
At ease.

636
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:40,460
Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't authorize your pass.

637
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:44,005
This is a furlough for men
who have passed the basic training.

638
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,261
Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.

639
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:53,181
I put in for this furlough
three weeks ago.

640
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,475
I'm getting married this afternoon.

641
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:58,436
It says you're not rifle qualified.

642
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:02,440
Well, I'm not required to carry
a rifle, sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...

643
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:05,777
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

644
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,738
"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,

645
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:13,118
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training."

646
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,995
And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, Private.

647
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:18,039
Pretty clear.

648
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:26,256
Show me you know how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.

649
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,258
- Corporal Cannon.
- Sir!

650
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:30,468
Hand Private Doss your firearm.

651
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:44,107
- I won't touch a rifle, sir.
- I'm not asking you, Private!

652
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,861
That is a direct order
from a company commander.

653
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:54,201
For God's sake, Doss,
you stop this nonsense and quit.

654
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:59,247
Refuse, and I will have no
recourse but to court-martial you,

655
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:02,709
and you will spend the duration
of the war in a military prison.

656
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:07,130
I can't, sir.

657
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:22,020
How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?

658
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:25,815
I think it's been long enough.

659
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:28,902
I'm so very sorry.

660
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:31,321
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

661
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:37,535
Some men might. Not my Desmond.

662
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:13,154
You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch

663
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:15,991
who cares only about regulations
and not his men.

664
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,120
May I?

665
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:30,088
I believe in this book
as much as any man.

666
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,882
And just like any man,
I wrestle with my conscience,

667
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:36,678
but what do you do when everything
you value in this world is under attack?

668
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:39,514
I don't know, sir.

669
00:51:40,974 --> 00:51:44,144
I ain't got answers
to questions that big,

670
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:47,939
but I also feel like
my values are under attack,

671
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:49,566
and I don't know why.

672
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:53,653
I don't give a rat's ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.

673
00:51:53,737 --> 00:51:55,947
If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,

674
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,032
what are you gonna do?

675
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,077
Hit him with your Bible?

676
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,412
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

677
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:06,041
You don't win wars
by giving up your life.

678
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:10,962
Look, I'm only here because I don't want
to see you rotting in a prison cell.

679
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:13,590
Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.

680
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,383
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

681
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:21,056
Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.

682
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,567
If I can't convince you, maybe she can.

683
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:36,029
They wouldn't let me call you.

684
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,949
I knew it wasn't your making.

685
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,747
What have they done to you?

686
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,584
It's okay, I'm all right.

687
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,921
I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall and lost.

688
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:56,216
They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.

689
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:58,301
Leavenworth.

690
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,303
There must be some other way.

691
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,222
I don't know what that could be.

692
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,432
I've done everything they asked me,
except this one thing,

693
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:07,102
and I'm being treated like
a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.

694
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:11,523
You tried.
Nobody can say you didn't.

695
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,233
But who are you going to save in prison?

696
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:16,778
Probably nobody.

697
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,656
Then why can't you just pick up
the stupid gun and wave it around?

698
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:22,450
You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.

699
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,704
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.

700
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:29,749
Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

701
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:44,722
Have I been prideful?

702
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,309
Maybe I am prideful.

703
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,357
But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself

704
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,734
if I don't stay true
to what I believe.

705
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,238
Much less how you could live with me.

706
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:05,743
I'd never be the man
that I want to be in your eyes.

707
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:16,796
I fell in love with you
because you weren't like anyone else

708
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,800
and you didn't try to be.

709
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:27,849
Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.

710
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:34,189
I will love you no matter what.

711
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:50,872
I don't know what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.

712
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:52,749
<i>They want him to plead guilty,</i>

713
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,001
<i>but then he'll get
a dishonorable discharge.</i>

714
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:58,671
Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure goes to prison.

715
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:00,673
<i>Either way, they'll call him a coward</i>

716
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:02,383
<i>and I don't see how
he can live with that.</i>

717
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:05,553
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

718
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,390
If you get to talk to him,

719
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:11,684
tell him that we love him
and that we're praying for him.

720
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:13,937
<i>We're praying for both of you.</i>

721
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,022
I will. Bye-bye.

722
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,162
<i>Tom, you're out of your mind,
you're delirious.</i>

723
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:32,747
<i>Of course, I'm out of my mind.</i>

724
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,625
<i>What do you think I am?
I'm out of my mind.</i>

725
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,585
<i>You leave this room.</i>

726
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:39,254
No, Tom! Put it down!

727
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,089
- Get away from me, woman!
- Hey!

728
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,441
I got that, sir.

729
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:13,246
May I help you, sir?

730
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,873
I wish to speak to
Brigadier General Musgrove.

731
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:18,793
Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.

732
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,385
Uh, if you would kindly tell him

733
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:31,263
Corporal Thomas Doss
would appreciate a brief word.

734
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:34,350
He's in a very important meeting.

735
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:38,479
I fought with him in France
at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.

736
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:44,360
Please, ma'am, it's most vital.

737
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:48,990
Thank you, ma'am.

738
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:55,955
There's a man out there, Tom Doss.

739
00:56:56,956 --> 00:56:58,040
Doss?

740
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,504
Be over in a minute.

741
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:07,133
You'll be home safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.

742
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,681
I love you.

743
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,647
This is a hearing into
the matter of Private Desmond Doss.

744
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,274
The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders

745
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:06,567
from his commanding officer.

746
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:08,945
How says the defendant?

747
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:12,824
Private Doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.

748
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,619
Is that so, Private?
I thought this was agreed.

749
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:19,163
You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.

750
00:58:20,957 --> 00:58:23,459
- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that?

751
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:26,212
You wish to proceed to a court-martial?

752
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,464
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

753
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:32,718
Well, on your head, then, Private.
Proceed.

754
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:40,268
Your Honor, Private Doss
waves his morality at us

755
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:42,478
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

756
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:46,232
He flaunts his contempt by directly
disobeying a series of direct orders

757
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,567
from his commanding officer.

758
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,278
When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against...

759
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,451
- You okay?
- Yes.

760
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,161
Are they still deliberating?

761
00:58:58,244 --> 00:58:59,454
Yes, sir.

762
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:01,289
Okay, now you go take this in there.

763
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,167
I can't.
It's strictly military personnel.

764
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,626
Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.

765
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,004
They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.

766
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:12,508
There is only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.

767
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:16,304
Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

768
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,350
Well, do you, Private?

769
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:29,817
- No, sir. I don't.
- Why are you contesting it, then?

770
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:33,154
Why is it so important to you, given
your refusal to even touch a weapon,

771
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,448
to serve in a combat unit?

772
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:40,369
Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

773
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:44,415
Everyone I knew
was on fire to join up, including me.

774
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:52,757
There were two men in my home town...
declared 4-F unfit.

775
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,343
They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.

776
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:02,433
I had a job in a defense plant
and I could've taken a deferment,

777
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:03,851
but that ain't right.

778
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:09,398
It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,

779
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:13,069
that I would just be
sitting at home safe.

780
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:14,654
I need to serve.

781
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:19,283
I got the energy
and the passion to serve as a medic.

782
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:24,830
Right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...

783
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:29,085
While everybody else is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.

784
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:34,799
With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,

785
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:36,884
it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me

786
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:39,428
to want to put a little bit
of it back together.

787
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,433
- Hmm.
- Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go--

788
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:46,602
No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.

789
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,187
I understand, sir,
but nobody's allowed...

790
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:50,606
- I have information that's important.
- Sir, you are not allowed...

791
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,608
While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,

792
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:55,486
the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...

793
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:58,864
What the hell is going on out there?

794
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:01,284
Let him go.

795
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:15,464
- That's a Great War uniform.
- It is, sir.

796
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:17,466
Sir, I need to show you this.

797
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,678
With respect, sir, you are no longer
a member of the military.

798
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:23,639
You are unable to attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.

799
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:26,767
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

800
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:30,104
You fight for your country,
you lose so much that was dear to you,

801
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,106
and then you're done with?

802
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,525
The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.

803
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:36,527
You were at Lys?

804
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:38,779
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

805
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:40,364
Twice decorated, I see.

806
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:42,325
Yes, sir.

807
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:44,827
I take it you are the Private's father.

808
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,787
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

809
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:50,583
Then, as a former military man,
you know there are laws here--

810
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,336
Sir, I know the law and I know
my son is protected by those laws.

811
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:55,671
They are framed in our constitution.

812
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,757
And I believe in them, as he does.

813
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,135
They are why I went
and fought to protect them.

814
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,346
At least, that is what
I thought I was doing.

815
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:04,889
Because if it wasn't for that,

816
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,433
then I have no idea what the hell
I was doing there, sir.

817
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,562
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

818
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,149
Let me have the letter.

819
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,116
You must go.

820
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:42,551
"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector

821
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,679
are protected by an Act of Congress

822
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:48,599
and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.

823
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:53,187
That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders to bear arms."

824
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:57,692
Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove,
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.

825
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:59,068
Colonel?

826
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:07,743
- I withdraw the charges, sir.
- Then this case is dismissed.

827
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:11,163
Private Doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire of battle

828
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:14,208
without a single weapon
to protect yourself.

829
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:18,879
You may resume your duties
and begin training as a combat medic.

830
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:27,555
- Where is he?
- Gone. Straight after.

831
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:29,473
I begged him to stay.
I told him you'd want to see him.

832
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:31,684
No, I understand.

833
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,686
When you get home,
you tell him I love him.

834
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,396
Okay. Okay.

835
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,688
You better come home to me.

01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,475
- Seems good to me.
- Clear.

850
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,060
- As gold.
- Clear.

851
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,646
All clear, Sarge!

852
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,166
Captain Glover.

853
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,711
Lieutenant Manville, 96th.

854
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,671
We've been assigned to you, sir.

855
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:49,381
Okay.

856
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:51,508
- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:52,968
This is, uh, Sergeant Howell.

858
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,303
- Good to meet you, sir.
- Sit down.

859
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:55,429
Who's Doss?

860
01:06:56,931 --> 01:06:58,223
Over there.

861
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:01,769
You Doss?

862
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,689
Irv Schecter.

863
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:16,367
You, and me and Page here are about the
only medics we got left in this area.

864
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,411
So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.

865
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,872
You just come off the line?

866
01:07:21,956 --> 01:07:23,207
What's it like?

867
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:26,961
I said, What's it like?

868
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,299
Hacksaw.

869
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:37,471
We climbed up six times.
Six times, they threw us off.

870
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:43,686
Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.

871
01:07:46,814 --> 01:07:47,982
They're animals.

872
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:52,027
Stinking animals.

873
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:54,279
Nips don't care if they live or die.

874
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,575
They want to die.
They keep coming at you.

875
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:01,203
And they ain't never going to give up.

876
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:03,747
Never.

877
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:05,666
Here. Hey, buddy.

878
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:13,382
The Japs
deliberately target the wounded.

879
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:16,468
Lose all your Red Cross markings.

880
01:08:16,552 --> 01:08:18,804
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

881
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,306
The white is a bull's-eye.

882
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,727
Here, I got you a new helmet.

883
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,396
One size fits all.

884
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:38,657
That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.

885
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:42,411
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

886
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:45,497
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

887
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:49,334
Take a breather. Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften them up for us.

888
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:18,322
Nobody can survive that shit.

889
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:21,408
Oh, but they can.

890
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:44,223
Lieutenant, these bunkers here,
here and here, is that accurate?

891
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:48,227
Yeah, there's three...

892
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:59,863
Yes, sir, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...

893
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,534
It's all different up there.

894
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:05,369
<i>All clear, Captain.</i>

895
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:09,540
Gents, move out.

896
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,276
It's blood.

897
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,610
No shit.

898
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,489
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

899
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:45,951
Keep climbing.

900
01:10:56,628 --> 01:10:58,505
Here, come on.

901
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:20,903
Coming through, make way.
Out of the way.

902
01:11:25,616 --> 01:11:26,783
- Brown.
- What?

903
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:27,951
Give this to Jessop.

904
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:29,036
Corporal!

905
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:16,476
Incoming!

906
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,063
Get down!

907
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:23,900
Get down!

908
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,666
Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.

909
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,170
- Beats me, pal.
- Where the...

910
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:48,967
Medic!

911
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:51,219
We're over here!

912
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,724
Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.

913
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:57,601
Come on, come on.

914
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:00,228
Come on, we're going to get you
under cover. Come on, come with me.

915
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:01,855
Come with me, Jack.

916
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,458
Keep moving forward! Move!

917
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,134
I can't see anything.

918
01:14:31,218 --> 01:14:32,969
- Is that one?
- I don't know. Just shoot!

919
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:41,019
All right, let's go.

920
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:45,857
Vito!

921
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:51,947
Oh, shit.

922
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:02,624
- Medic! Vito's down!
- I'm coming!

923
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,793
Okay. I'm here.

924
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:19,099
Get out of the way!

925
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:51,548
You hurt?

926
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:53,967
I'm fine.

927
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:14,196
Come on, I got you, Ralph.
Just breathe.

928
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:22,287
Just breathe. Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.

929
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,457
Just breathe, Ralph, just breathe.

930
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:29,127
I got you, I got you.
I got you. Come on.

931
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:34,925
Hey! Hey! Give him a shot
of morphine and move on.

932
01:16:36,176 --> 01:16:37,552
He's not going to last a day.

933
01:16:37,636 --> 01:16:41,014
Please. Please, Doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.

934
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,558
Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.

935
01:16:43,642 --> 01:16:45,560
I've got kids!

936
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:48,688
Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.

937
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:51,775
I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.

938
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:55,070
I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.

939
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,865
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

940
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:00,534
It's going to kick in real quick, Ralph.

941
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:02,619
We're going to get you shifted.

942
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:06,206
Stretcher! Stretcher!

943
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:13,672
- Get up. Keep moving, son.
- I can't, I'm wounded.

944
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:14,965
There's nothing wrong with you.

945
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,385
Shit! Hang on, kid.

946
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:24,140
Move. A sitting duck's a dead one.

947
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:26,935
Move. Go, go, go!

948
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:28,687
This guy's a priority.

949
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:32,732
We got him, we got him. Here.

950
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:37,862
A priority? You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead before we get him down.

951
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:39,114
You don't know that!

952
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:44,119
Get him down. All right? Huh?

953
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:46,997
- Okay. Okay. Go.
- Okay. Okay.

954
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:50,000
It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.

955
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:58,633
Medic! Help! Help.

956
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:01,928
I figure if we can't see them,
then they can't see us neither.

957
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,431
Help!

958
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,944
I got you, Frank. Where you hit?

959
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:32,083
- I think they can see us, smart ass!
- Doss, come on, come on.

960
01:18:32,167 --> 01:18:33,376
Give me a hand here.

961
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:38,715
Get down, sir.

962
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,967
Over there! The bunkers.

963
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,764
I see them. Better stay down, sir.

964
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:52,312
- I got 'em, dead ahead.
- Yeah, I see 'em, too.

965
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,606
Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything you've got.

966
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:56,733
I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.

967
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,951
You keep that tight, you're going to be
right as rain. All right?

968
01:19:07,035 --> 01:19:08,787
I got him, Doss. I got him.

969
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,955
Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.

970
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,082
Hey.

971
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:14,125
You doing okay?

972
01:19:14,209 --> 01:19:15,293
Okay.

973
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:28,932
And, fire!

974
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:42,696
Down!

975
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,535
Son of a bitch.

976
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:51,663
- You, get on it.
- Yes, sir!

977
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,875
Take 'em. Go. Fire!

978
01:20:02,549 --> 01:20:03,883
Cover!

979
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:14,561
Go, go. Go, Ghoul.
Get in the hole. Stay there.

980
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:21,901
Go! Go, Smitty,
we'll cover you. Leapfrog.

981
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:29,200
Cover.

982
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,584
Satchel!

983
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,756
- Ghoul!
- Clear.

984
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:51,097
Come on, stick it. Stick it, Ghoul.

985
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:55,143
Cover! Cover!

986
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,698
Son of a bitch.

987
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:21,169
Cover his ass.

988
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:26,174
Medic! Medic! Help me.

989
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:54,577
Go!

990
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,374
Medic!

991
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:47,380
I'm here. Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!

992
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:19,370
Go, go, go!

993
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:36,763
Ghoul. Ghoul.

994
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:40,141
You're okay. Where you hit?

995
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,730
You got a bump on the head, that's okay.

996
01:23:46,481 --> 01:23:47,774
What's your name?

997
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:50,318
- Andy.
- Andy what?

998
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:52,487
Andy Walker.

999
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:54,364
Also known as?

1000
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:56,741
Ghoul.

1001
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,660
Ghoul. Ghoul, you're okay, you're okay.

1002
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:05,959
Good job, men. Good work.

1003
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:08,544
Dig in for the night.
We hold this spot,

1004
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:11,214
we mop up the rest
of the ridge tomorrow.

1005
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:16,469
Okay, boys. Find yourself a nice
safe hole in or near the bunker.

1006
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,471
Rotate watch every two hours.

1007
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:21,641
We don't know what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.

1008
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:23,518
And shoot anything
that don't speak English.

1009
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:26,312
- Does that include Grease, Sarge?
- Particularly him.

1010
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:28,690
I don't care if you need to
take a piss or a dump,

1011
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:30,775
it ain't safe to go out there alone.

1012
01:24:30,858 --> 01:24:32,360
Over here, now!

1013
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:33,945
Where the hell are you going, Doss?

1014
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:37,657
Still more wounded out there, Sarge.

1015
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,367
I'll go with him.

1016
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,494
Be smart. Keep your ears down.

1017
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:45,081
All right, let's find a spot.

1018
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:57,135
Rinnelli and Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes, just straight off.

1019
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,555
Straight off.

1020
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:04,851
Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.

1021
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,020
Page and Unger.

1022
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,357
Ralston.

1023
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:18,281
"In peace, sons bury their fathers,
in war, fathers bury their sons."

1024
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:23,202
You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?

1025
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:27,206
It don't help none.

1026
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:31,794
Yeah, you got that right. Not here.

1027
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:37,175
Hey, give me that.

1028
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:46,893
Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.

1029
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:49,145
This man is going to need some plasma.

1030
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:50,605
- You got it.
- Leave him with us.

1031
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:52,815
Okay. You're okay now. They got you.

1032
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:03,618
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1033
01:26:04,494 --> 01:26:05,578
Sounds good to me.

1034
01:26:07,205 --> 01:26:08,456
Put your helmet on.

1035
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:19,884
You ain't going to eat them?

1036
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:24,889
I don't eat meat. Help yourself.

1037
01:26:26,516 --> 01:26:27,683
Of course you don't.

1038
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:38,194
That's one heck of a dame.

1039
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,741
You know you're fighting out of your
weight class with her, don't you?

1040
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:52,583
Yes, I do.

1041
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:55,878
Don't tell her that.

1042
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,922
She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.

1043
01:26:58,005 --> 01:26:59,966
Yeah, until she got to know you.

1044
01:27:01,759 --> 01:27:03,636
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1045
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:05,304
Sometimes?

1046
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:10,726
Yeah, all right. All right.

1047
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:38,379
These Japs are sneaky.

1048
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:42,842
I'll take first watch, all right?
You get some shut-eye.

1049
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:29,889
Hell of a dream.

1050
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:51,994
Dreamed I got myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.

1051
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:54,789
Rifle's just there.

1052
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:01,128
It won't bite.

1053
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:04,006
Yeah, it will.

1054
01:29:06,092 --> 01:29:07,468
Look around you.

1055
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:09,845
After what we've just been through,

1056
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:11,973
any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.

1057
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,975
I never claimed to be sane.

1058
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:21,691
My daddy's a drunk.

1059
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:27,029
He fought it for years,
but it kind of got a hold of him hard.

1060
01:29:27,113 --> 01:29:28,281
Made him mean.

1061
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:29,657
Least you knew him.

1062
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:32,952
Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,
and none of them worth a damn, so...

1063
01:29:34,829 --> 01:29:36,414
So, your momma raised you?

1064
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:39,542
I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage when I was five.

1065
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:40,918
Never saw her again.

1066
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:44,839
I learned how to hate quick.

1067
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:49,885
I learned how to judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.

1068
01:29:59,228 --> 01:30:02,148
My daddy used to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,

1069
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:04,358
and then whip us just because it set.

1070
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,321
I could take that...

1071
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,908
...but when he would
do it to our momma...

1072
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:15,161
Get away from me, woman!

1073
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:25,796
That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?

1074
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,715
Pull the damn trigger.

1075
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:32,345
Stop it! Stop!

1076
01:30:37,433 --> 01:30:38,726
But you didn't kill him?

1077
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:43,314
In my heart, I did.

1078
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:06,712
So that's why I made my promise to God,

1079
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:08,881
I ain't never going to
touch a gun again.

1080
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:16,097
Well, I ain't giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.

1081
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:39,453
Son of a...

1082
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,375
Son of a bitch.

1083
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:23,330
Move, move! Get your asses over here.

1084
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:24,707
Let's go!

1085
01:32:43,309 --> 01:32:46,604
Fall back, fall back! Go!

1086
01:33:00,618 --> 01:33:02,703
They're coming from underground.

1087
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:06,665
Searchlight, this is Baker Six.
Request immediate support.

1088
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:09,627
Target is
Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.

1089
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:11,670
Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,

1090
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:13,297
but I don't expect to
be here much longer!

1091
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,717
I called an artillery strike.

1092
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,470
Fall back. Move. Move!

1093
01:33:25,976 --> 01:33:28,103
Fall back! Incoming!

1094
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:57,800
Hey, buddy. I'm right here. Right here.

1095
01:34:05,599 --> 01:34:06,600
Okay.

1096
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:08,894
Cover me.

1097
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:12,940
Go, go!

1098
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:27,371
Get out of here, kid!

1099
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:31,417
Come here, son.

1100
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,423
You know what to do.
Keep pressure on it.

1101
01:34:41,302 --> 01:34:43,721
No! Don't need plasma. Give it to him.

1102
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:48,017
Over there. I'll be okay. Go. Go.

1103
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,768
- Grease! Get Irv's back.
- What?

1104
01:34:49,852 --> 01:34:51,854
- You got it, okay.
- See you soon.

1105
01:34:57,943 --> 01:34:59,486
Come on. Come on.

1106
01:35:02,865 --> 01:35:05,826
We gotta move right now.
Come on, come on.

1107
01:35:30,434 --> 01:35:32,102
Go! Go! Go!

1108
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:40,611
Change!

1109
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,910
There's too many,
get the hell out of here!

1110
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:49,703
Move! Move!

1111
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:36,834
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's going to help the pain.

1112
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:42,965
No, don't. Don't you do that. Come on.

1113
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:45,676
Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.

1114
01:37:07,281 --> 01:37:08,490
- Hey!
- Yeah.

1115
01:37:08,574 --> 01:37:09,950
Help me get him down.
Help me get him down.

1116
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:11,535
Yeah.

1117
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,036
Come on, let's move. Come on.

1118
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,080
Can't help him, buddy, he's gone.

1119
01:37:15,164 --> 01:37:17,499
- No.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

1120
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:18,876
Let's go!

1121
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:21,920
Come on, let's go.

1122
01:37:31,138 --> 01:37:32,806
Come on. Everyone.

1123
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:34,266
Off the ridge!

1124
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:14,431
What is it you want of me?

1125
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:24,107
I don't understand.

1126
01:38:30,531 --> 01:38:32,074
I can't hear you.

1127
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:35,828
Medic, help me! Help me!

1128
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:37,621
Help me!

1129
01:38:42,459 --> 01:38:44,127
Help me, Lord.

1130
01:38:44,211 --> 01:38:45,754
All right.

1131
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:07,234
You're in good hands.
Easy does it. Easy.

1132
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:09,111
...six... eight...

1133
01:39:10,487 --> 01:39:11,947
Fourteen.

1134
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,615
Get these men secured immediately.

1135
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:14,825
Yes, sir.

1136
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:19,580
- Private Ford, how many?
- Thirty-two only came down, sir.

1137
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:21,206
- Good Lord.
- Let's go!

1138
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:25,002
- Let's load 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

1139
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:06,418
Harry. It's Desmond.

1140
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:10,047
We going to fix you up.
You just got to keep breathing. Okay?

1141
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:14,092
- Colonel wants to see you, sir.
- I need your jeep.

1142
01:40:14,176 --> 01:40:16,678
You two stay here, keep watch,
keep your eyes peeled for Japs.

1143
01:40:16,762 --> 01:40:18,305
- No, but...
- Stay here! Keep watch.

1144
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:19,681
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1145
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,485
Help. Help me.

1146
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:34,905
Watch out. I got you.

1147
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:41,620
Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.

1148
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:44,206
- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay.

1149
01:41:00,138 --> 01:41:01,890
Easy, fellas, easy.

1150
01:41:01,974 --> 01:41:03,225
Here we go.

1151
01:41:07,604 --> 01:41:10,565
Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of three. One, two, three.

1152
01:41:12,776 --> 01:41:14,987
Help, medic over here!

1153
01:41:16,989 --> 01:41:18,323
It's okay, buddy, hold it together.

1154
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:23,036
We're at the edge, Eric.

1155
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,914
You just sit tight, okay?

1156
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:47,894
You're okay, Eric.
You're okay, buddy.

1157
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:54,985
Son of a gun, this is going to work.

1158
01:41:55,068 --> 01:41:57,029
One for each leg, Eric.

1159
01:41:57,112 --> 01:42:00,115
We're going to get you dressed up
in a jiffy and get you down.

1160
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:01,950
I got you.

1161
01:42:03,577 --> 01:42:05,370
I got you now, Eric.

1162
01:42:05,454 --> 01:42:08,373
You have to trust me now, Eric.
You're gonna have to trust me.

1163
01:42:37,069 --> 01:42:38,278
Japs!

1164
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:41,531
Hold on, one of ours.
Hold on! Let's go, let's go!

1165
01:42:43,408 --> 01:42:46,620
I got you. I got you. I got you.

1166
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:50,457
Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.

1167
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,339
Hank, another one.

1168
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:05,055
Colonel, call off the artillery
attack on Hacksaw.

1169
01:43:05,138 --> 01:43:08,517
Couldn't call it in. There's still
over 100 men left up there.

1170
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,936
Tell them to call off
the artillery on Hacksaw.

1171
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:15,357
Sit down, Jack.
I'll get you a drink.

1172
01:43:26,868 --> 01:43:28,453
We just lost our cover.

1173
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:33,291
They're stirrin',
we got to move. Come on.

1174
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:43,176
About time.
They just keep coming by the...

1175
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,887
- OK, OK. Pick it up.
- I got this.

1176
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:25,510
Doss. Doss.

1177
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:29,973
Help. Help me.

1178
01:44:41,443 --> 01:44:45,363
You're gonna have to trust me.
Take a breath.

1179
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:46,967
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

1180
01:45:49,386 --> 01:45:52,055
Jack, you don't know
if your men up there are dead or alive.

1181
01:45:52,138 --> 01:45:54,391
You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.

1182
01:45:54,474 --> 01:45:55,517
You'll end up killing the rest of them.

1183
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,601
Then give me the reinforcements.

1184
01:45:56,685 --> 01:46:00,438
I don't have any fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.

1185
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:02,607
Three battalions got wiped out today.

1186
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:05,360
It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.

1187
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:07,070
I need them faster than that.

1188
01:47:58,932 --> 01:48:01,726
It's okay, it's okay.

1189
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:03,311
It's all right.
It's all right.

1190
01:48:04,104 --> 01:48:05,563
Everything's okay.

1191
01:48:22,664 --> 01:48:24,416
Morphine. It's good.

1192
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:27,919
Shh.

1193
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:05,165
Pinnick, Pinnick. Pinnick. It's Doss.

1194
01:49:05,248 --> 01:49:08,793
It's Doss. Be quiet.
Be quiet. I got you.

1195
01:49:08,877 --> 01:49:11,880
- Are you hit?
- Yeah. I can't see.

1196
01:49:11,963 --> 01:49:14,299
Be quiet. Just be quiet.

1197
01:49:15,842 --> 01:49:21,639
Hold still now. I got you. Hold tight.

1198
01:49:21,723 --> 01:49:24,434
There you go. Try now. Try now.

1199
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:30,315
I thought I was blind!

1200
01:49:30,398 --> 01:49:32,817
Shh... Keep it down. Can you walk?

1201
01:49:32,901 --> 01:49:34,235
I don't know.

1202
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:36,196
We got to get out of here, okay?
Come on.

1203
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:52,378
Good. Okay, we got you.

1204
01:49:52,462 --> 01:49:53,713
We got you.

1205
01:50:07,477 --> 01:50:09,229
Hey, Ted.

1206
01:50:09,312 --> 01:50:12,690
It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.

1207
01:50:14,484 --> 01:50:17,612
- You ready to get out of here?
- Sure am.

1208
01:50:32,335 --> 01:50:36,422
Please, Lord, help me get one more.

1209
01:50:36,506 --> 01:50:38,216
Help me get one more.

1210
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:08,746
Please, help me get one more.

1211
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:30,852
One more. Help me get one more.

1212
01:51:43,114 --> 01:51:47,243
One more. Help me get one more.

1213
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:51,706
One more.

1214
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:54,834
Coming through.

1215
01:51:57,587 --> 01:51:59,380
Where the hell
are these guys coming from?

1216
01:51:59,464 --> 01:52:00,632
From Hacksaw.

1217
01:52:00,715 --> 01:52:03,426
- I thought they pulled out.
- Not all of them.

1218
01:52:03,509 --> 01:52:06,429
Some nut's up there
dragging wounded from the top.

1219
01:52:06,512 --> 01:52:09,265
Even lowered a couple of Japs.

1220
01:52:09,349 --> 01:52:12,477
They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.

1221
01:52:13,186 --> 01:52:16,272
Easy, easy. All set, move out.

1222
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:50,014
Get in here.
There's Nips everywhere.

1223
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:55,269
Son of a bitch.
Private Corn Stalk.

1224
01:52:55,353 --> 01:52:57,397
You are nothing
if not full of surprises.

1225
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,315
You want some morphine?

1226
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:03,194
- Hell, yes. That or a bullet.
- Okay.

1227
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:05,530
There. There you go.

1228
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:12,578
All right, let me see. Let me see.

1229
01:53:12,662 --> 01:53:15,540
How's this doing?
Okay, not bad.

1230
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:19,293
Let me see.

1231
01:53:19,377 --> 01:53:20,878
It looks much worse than it is.

1232
01:53:20,962 --> 01:53:22,714
Girls will still want to kiss you.

1233
01:53:24,382 --> 01:53:27,593
Sarge, you okay here for a while?

1234
01:53:27,677 --> 01:53:29,887
Yeah, fine. Get out of here.

1235
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:31,597
I'm coming back.

1236
01:53:31,681 --> 01:53:33,808
You ready? Let's go.
You and me, come on.

1237
01:54:08,718 --> 01:54:11,179
Captain.
There's something you gotta see.

1238
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:16,225
Our guys have been
coming down in droves all night.

1239
01:54:16,309 --> 01:54:18,686
And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see that guy again.

1240
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:20,396
Come on, follow me.
He's right here.

1241
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:26,360
What the hell is this?

1242
01:54:26,444 --> 01:54:27,904
How you doing, sir?

1243
01:54:27,987 --> 01:54:29,363
Hey, Cap.

1244
01:54:29,447 --> 01:54:30,615
Captain.

1245
01:54:32,992 --> 01:54:35,953
- It's good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover, sir.

1246
01:54:36,037 --> 01:54:37,413
How'd you get down, son?

1247
01:54:37,497 --> 01:54:40,500
Doss. Howell's still up there.

1248
01:54:40,583 --> 01:54:43,044
What, Howell and Doss did this?

1249
01:54:43,127 --> 01:54:45,171
Mostly just Doss.

1250
01:54:45,254 --> 01:54:47,048
- Just Doss?
- Just Doss.

1251
01:54:47,131 --> 01:54:49,592
Yeah, Doss, the coward.

1252
01:56:05,668 --> 01:56:08,921
- You're like gum on a shoe, ain't you?
- Give me this.

1253
01:56:09,005 --> 01:56:11,382
It's a bit late for target
practice now, don't you think?

1254
01:56:15,636 --> 01:56:17,597
- Jump on it.
- You're kidding.

1255
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,473
No, I'm going to drag you.

1256
01:56:24,437 --> 01:56:25,605
Let's do it.

1257
01:56:28,274 --> 01:56:29,525
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1258
01:56:29,609 --> 01:56:30,610
Let's go.

1259
01:56:35,573 --> 01:56:36,949
We got company.

1260
01:56:37,033 --> 01:56:38,618
Come on.

1261
01:56:59,055 --> 01:57:00,556
Arms up.

1262
01:57:01,933 --> 01:57:03,476
You gotta be kidding me, Corn Stalk.

1263
01:57:03,559 --> 01:57:05,394
"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."

1264
01:57:06,854 --> 01:57:08,439
Come on.

1265
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:12,318
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

1266
01:57:12,401 --> 01:57:13,694
Get on.

1267
01:57:40,388 --> 01:57:42,682
- Put me down!
- Yes, Sarge.

1268
01:57:42,765 --> 01:57:45,309
- Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.

1269
01:57:47,019 --> 01:57:49,313
- What the hell?
- He's got Japs on his tail.

1270
01:58:21,303 --> 01:58:22,555
We got him.

1271
01:58:22,638 --> 01:58:24,432
That's good. That's good.

1272
01:58:24,515 --> 01:58:26,517
It's okay, we got him.

1273
01:58:31,439 --> 01:58:33,024
Whoa, whoa...

1274
01:58:33,107 --> 01:58:35,901
- It's okay, Doss.
- Come on, Doss, come on.

1275
01:58:35,985 --> 01:58:38,696
- You're safe.
- Come on, Doss.

1276
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,423
Desmond, it's all right, it's all right.

1277
01:58:58,883 --> 01:59:00,217
Desmond.

1278
01:59:02,344 --> 01:59:05,264
Easy, easy. Here, come on.

1279
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:12,688
Are you wounded?

1280
01:59:13,856 --> 01:59:15,691
Mmm...

1281
01:59:17,193 --> 01:59:19,070
No. No.

1282
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:24,283
Let's get this soldier
to a hospital tent, right now.

1283
01:59:24,366 --> 01:59:26,827
- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.

1284
01:59:26,911 --> 01:59:28,162
Make some space.

1285
02:00:11,455 --> 02:00:13,958
We need someone
to come and clean up in here.

1286
02:00:16,085 --> 02:00:17,503
Where's Irv?

1287
02:00:17,586 --> 02:00:20,381
- Irv? You mean, Schecter the medic?
- Yeah.

1288
02:00:20,464 --> 02:00:23,676
He didn't make it.
He died of shock. No plasma.

1289
02:00:25,427 --> 02:00:26,554
Sorry.

1290
02:01:02,089 --> 02:01:05,342
All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.

1291
02:01:10,181 --> 02:01:12,099
You've done more than
any other man could have done

1292
02:01:12,183 --> 02:01:14,560
in the service of his country.

1293
02:01:14,643 --> 02:01:17,146
And I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.

1294
02:01:18,772 --> 02:01:20,774
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1295
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,581
We have to go back up tomorrow.

1296
02:01:38,334 --> 02:01:40,961
I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

1297
02:01:47,176 --> 02:01:49,553
Most of these men
don't believe the same way you do.

1298
02:01:51,555 --> 02:01:55,809
But they believe so much
in how much you believe.

1299
02:01:58,979 --> 02:02:01,857
And what you did on that ridge,
it's nothing short of a miracle,

1300
02:02:01,941 --> 02:02:03,692
and they want a piece of it.

1301
02:02:06,612 --> 02:02:08,697
And they're not going
to go up there without you.

1302
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,710
<i>What the hell is your delay, Captain?</i>

1303
02:02:21,794 --> 02:02:23,545
<i>You were supposed to begin
that assault 10 minutes ago!</i>

1304
02:02:23,629 --> 02:02:26,423
- We're waiting, sir.
- Waiting for what?

1305
02:02:29,093 --> 02:02:31,929
For Private Doss
to finish praying for us, sir.

1306
02:02:32,012 --> 02:02:33,639
<i>Private Doss is praying for you?</i>

1307
02:02:33,722 --> 02:02:35,516
<i>Who the hell is Private Doss?</i>

1308
02:02:57,288 --> 02:02:58,539
Let's go to work.

1309
02:04:52,486 --> 02:04:54,321
Down. Get down!

1310
02:04:54,405 --> 02:04:57,741
Get on the ground.
On the ground. Now!

1311
02:05:37,406 --> 02:05:39,366
Lay down, lay down.
I got the morphine.

1312
02:05:40,993 --> 02:05:42,911
Let's go, let's get
these men out of here.

1313
02:05:48,584 --> 02:05:52,671
My Bible... My Bible. My Bible...

1314
02:05:52,754 --> 02:05:55,507
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

1315
02:05:55,591 --> 02:05:58,135
My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.

1316
02:05:59,052 --> 02:06:00,095
Okay.

1317
02:07:15,462 --> 02:07:19,383
You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken Hacksaw.

1318
02:07:23,512 --> 02:07:25,722
Hold up, hold up! Desmond!

1319
02:07:27,849 --> 02:07:29,017
Desmond.

1320
02:09:15,916 --> 02:09:19,044
<i>I was praying the whole time.</i>

1321
02:09:19,127 --> 02:09:24,341
I just kept praying,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1322
02:09:24,424 --> 02:09:29,554
When I got this, I said,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1323
02:09:35,644 --> 02:09:38,063
<i>I would say anyone is wrong</i>

1324
02:09:38,146 --> 02:09:40,107
<i>to try to compromise
somebody's conviction.</i>

1325
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:43,318
I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.

1326
02:09:43,402 --> 02:09:47,781
When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.

1327
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:50,826
That's what you are.

1328
02:09:52,327 --> 02:09:54,579
<i>Even though I said those things to him</i>

1329
02:09:54,663 --> 02:09:55,914
<i>in regard to carrying a rifle,</i>

1330
02:09:55,997 --> 02:10:02,587
then he would never be by my
damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1331
02:10:02,671 --> 02:10:05,549
<i>But then, in the long run,</i>

1332
02:10:05,632 --> 02:10:10,345
<i>finding out that he was one
of the bravest persons alive.</i>

1333
02:10:10,429 --> 02:10:13,181
And then to have him
end up saving my life

1334
02:10:13,265 --> 02:10:16,435
was the irony of the whole thing.

1335
02:10:16,518 --> 02:10:21,606
Blood had run down
into the fella's face and eyes.

1336
02:10:21,857 --> 02:10:25,736
He was laying there just
groaning and calling for a medic.

1337
02:10:27,028 --> 02:10:34,077
I took water from my canteen,
got some bandage, and I washed his face.

1338
02:10:34,161 --> 02:10:38,999
And when I... was washing his eyes,
his eyes came open.

1339
02:10:39,082 --> 02:10:42,753
Man, he just lit up.

1340
02:10:43,879 --> 02:10:47,799
He says, "I thought I was blind."

1341
02:10:47,883 --> 02:10:50,969
And if I hadn't got anything
more out of the war

1342
02:10:51,052 --> 02:10:55,891
than that smile he gave me,
I'd have been well repaid.
